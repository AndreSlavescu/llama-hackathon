- type of property (ex. condo, townhouse, detached house, etc.)
- how much natural light the property gets
- the amount of greenery
- the size of the outdoor space (if any)
- the age of the property
- the condition of the property
- the neighbourhood the property is located in, and if it's a desirable or detested area
- transit accessibility
- drivability in the area
- garage size (if any)
- nearby amenities, restaurants, schools, attractions, parks, shopping centres, grocery stores, and entertainment
- safety and security features
- the views out of the windows (ex. if the view is of a brick wall, or the neighbouring building, or the city skyline)
